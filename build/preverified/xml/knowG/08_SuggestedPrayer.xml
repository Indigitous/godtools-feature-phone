    <pbutton1>Here's a suggested prayer</pbutton1>
	<ptext1 size="90" modifier="italics" textalign="left" translate="true">I want to know you personally. I'm sorry for going my own way. Please forgive me for all my sin. Thank you for dying on the cross to pay for my sin. I agree to turn from my old ways and follow you as my Saviour and Lord. Please come and take first place in my life.  Could you say this to God and mean it?  Is there anything stopping you from saying this right now?</ptext1>
