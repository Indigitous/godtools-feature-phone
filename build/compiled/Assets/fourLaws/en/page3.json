	"SubTitle1":"Man Is Sinful",
	"Content1":"All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\" (Romans 3:23) Man was created to have fellowship with God; but, because of his own stubborn self-will, he chose to go his own independent way and fellowship with God was broken. This self-will, characterized by an attitude of active rebellion or passive indifference, is an evidence of what the Bible calls sin.",
	"SubTitle2":"Man Is Separated",
	"Content2":"The wages of sin is death\" [spiritual separation from God]. (Romans 6:23) This diagram illustrates that God is holy and man is sinful. A great gulf separates the two. The arrows illustrate that man is continually trying to reach God and the abundant life through his own efforts, such as a good life, philosophy, or religion, but he inevitably fails.",
	"End":"The third principle explains the only way to bridge this gulf..."
